# PersistentELO

Library for Persistent ELO rankings. 

This library will allow for people to create a set of players, an elo system, and a ranking board. 

The players can then be compared to see their expected scores against each other and to calculate ratings after matches are played. 

The ranking system will store all of the players in a database so that the rankings are persistent.
